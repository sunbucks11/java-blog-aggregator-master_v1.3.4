api.text=In order to access the API, you need two piece of information. The first is a member email which is a unique code that we use to identify your account. The other is an API Token which acts as a password when you connect to the API. You can get both of those here. You should click on the "Generate a new API Token" to display it. You'll need to remember both of those later when you start writing code.
